#' This lab introduces you to navigating histories on GitHub, `git checkout`, and `git branch`, as well as the git side of the workflow we'll use for labs.  
#' 
#' *Summary*: 
#' 1. Use `git checkout [hash]` to go back to a previous commit. 
#' 2. Use `git checkout [branch]` to move to the latest commit for a branch. 
#' 3. The git side of the lab workflow goes like this: 
#'   a. Fork and clone the lab repo from <https://github.com/data-science-methods>. 
#'   b. Follow the instructions in `lab.R`
#'   c. When you're finished, push the results back up to GitHub and file a pull request against the original repo. 
#'   


#' # Problem 1 #
#' Navigate to the GitHub repo for this lab assignment, <https://github.com/data-science-methods/lab-w2-git>.  Fork the lab, then clone it to your working machine.  Open the file `lab.R` in a *new* R session.  
#' 


#' # Problem 2 #
#' Edit `lab.R`.  You don't need to do anything in particular, but they should be trackable changes by it.  Add and commit the changes to your working machine.  
#' 
#is this dif - yes it tracked, a miracle!

#' # Problem 3 #
#' Edit `lab.R` again.  Add and commit the changes to your working machine, *and then* push them to your GitHub fork.  
#' 
#Ok, here is another change

#' # Problem 4 #
#' 1. Open your fork of the lab repo on GitHub.  The URL will be something like <https://github.com/username/lab-w2-git>.  
#' 2. Find and click on the history button, above the file list and to the right. (I wasn't able to find a keyboard shortcut for this. :-( )

#+ fig.cap="The history button in GitHub is immediately above the file list, on the right"
include_graphics(file.path('img', 'history.png'))

#' 3. Look through the history for your commit from problem 2.  Click on the *comment* to view the *diff*, or the changes made by that commit.  
#' 4. Back on the history page, find the *hash* on the right side.  It should be a series of 7 letters and numbers.  This is an ID code that git uses to track each individual commit.  Click on the clipboard icon to copy the hash. 

#+ fig.cap="The hash for a commit is the series of 7 letters on the right side of the entry in the history view."
include_graphics(file.path('img', 'hash.png'))

#'


#' # Problem 5 #
#' 1. Back on your working machine, enter the following into the command line, pasting your hash in place of the example. 
#' 
#' ```
#' $ git checkout 5fc4a1cbe6331e1a38a70ed49d7bfc8182461bc2
#' ```
#' 
#' 2. Look at `lab.R`. Your edits from Problem 3 are gone! 
#' 3. Check `git status`. Note that it says `HEAD detached at [hash]` in red.  This means that making commits right now will cause serious problems.  (To confirm: git won't let us make commits with a detached HEAD.)
#' 4. To get out of this "detached HEAD" state, do the following:  
#' ```
#' $ git checkout main
#' ```
#' 5. Confirm that your edits from Problem 3 have been restored and that `git status` isn't warning at you about a detached HEAD. 
#' 

#' # Problem 6 #
#' Suppose that the changes from Problem 3 caused things to break, and we want to permanently go back to the previous state of things.  We do that using `git revert`.  
#' 1. In the GitHub history, find the hash for the commit that *caused* the breaking changes.  
#'   - This is the commit from Problem 3, not the previous commit.  
#'   - Note that this is different from the commit we used in Problem 5. 
#' 2. Do the following: 
#' ```
#' $ git revert [erroneous commit ID]`
#' ```
#' 3. Confirm that the changes from Problem 3 have been undone.  Push to GitHub, and examine the history view.
